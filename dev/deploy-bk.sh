What is a script / shell_script?
  This is file containing one or more commands 
  Shell scripts has ".sh" or ".sc" for extension. 
     hello.sh 
       echo "DevOps is great" 
       whoami 
       date  
     hello.sc  

File Naming convention :
  bash_shell_script: -- hello.sc /  greet.sh 
  java_code: [FileName.java], deploy.java 
  python_code: hello_world.py
  yaml_code: app.yml 
  xml_code: app.yml 
  html_code: index.html

1.   .#!/bin/bash
#!/bin/bash
# shell script is a collection of commands
echo "Good morning"
echo "Today is"
date
echo "Today's class was indeed great"

-bash: ./hello.sh: Permission denied

chmod +x hello.sh   
-rwxrwxr-x. 1 simon simon 141 Aug  2 20:11 hello.sh

How to run a script??:
By using relative path to the script/file  
   . hello.sh

How to write a good shell scripts or Best practices in scripting??
1. Making your scripts/code easily understood and re-usable.
   Maintain best naming convention 
     monitor_servers.sh 
     monitor_servers.py 
     deploy_app.java 
     mongo_db.sh   

2. Use comments  
    Comments explains the script/code better 
 
 filemgt.sh
    Comments: single line comments
              multi-line comment   
      This script is for file management
      Run this script only in Linux server 
      You require sudo access to run this script  
      slc.sh  
      #!/bin/sh
      # whoami
       echo "single line comments starts"
       #This script is for file management
       #Run this script only in Linux server
       #You require sudo access to run this script
       echo "single line comments ends"
       date

multi-line comment :
<<comment
      This script is for file management
      Run this script only in Linux server 
      You require sudo access to run this script  
comment 

<<mlc
      This script is for file management
      Run this script only in Linux server 
      You require sudo access to run this script  
mlc

mlc.sh 
#!/bin/bash 
echo "multi-line comments starts"
<<dev
      This script is for file management
      Run this script only in Linux server 
      You require sudo access to run this script  
dev  
echo "multi-line comments ends"
whoami 
date  

jenkins.groovy scripts:
  multi-line comment 
  /* 

  */
sinle-line comment 
  // 

xml:

3. Varaibles make your script portable  
   greet.sh  
   name=LandmarkTechnolgy
   echo "welcome $name"
========================================================

Variables:
   user defined Variables  = UDV 
   system defined Variables = SDV 
     SDV are generally called Environmental Varaibles     
     env  
     [simon@sc sc]$  echo $HISTSIZE
     1000
     export HISTSIZE=2000  

Changing SDV:  
 1. export HISTSIZE=2000 
    CHANGES WILL ONLY be effected FOR THE CURRENT SESSION/shell

 2. vi .bashrc or vi .bash_profile  
    Changes effected in the users profile will survive a reboot 
    add:
        export HISTSIZE=700 
    run: source .bash_profile

   echo "export HISTSIZE=800" >> .bashrc 
   source .bashrc

Write a script to create users in a redhat Linux server.
Make your script dynamic/re-usable/portable
Explain some of the projects you are managing in Landmark?
  I have written bash_shell_scripts use to create and manager users.  

what is a script = collection of commands 
#!/bin/sh
# This script will create user accounts in Linux
# Run this script with sudo access
   echo "Please enter the username you want to create"
   read username
   sudo useradd $username
   echo $username created successfully

#!/bin/sh
# You need to be root or have sudo access to execute this script
# This script will create  a new user's account in a linux server
echo "Please enter the userName for the account you want to create!"
read userName
echo "The user's name you entered is: "  $userName
sudo useradd   $userName
echo "$userName user account created successfully"
echo "Set the password for $userName"
sudo passwd $userName  

simple arithmetic operation commands:

 expr x - y    = 
 expr x  \* y  =  
 expr x / y    =
 expr x % y    = 

sao2.sh  
echo "Please enter a number"
read a 
echo please enter another number
read b    
echo "The sum total is" `expr $a + $b`
echo "The sum difference is" `expr $a - $b`
echo "The multiple total is" `expr $a \* $b`

sao.sh  
echo "How much did you buy your home"
read cost  
echo "How much are you selling your home today"
read revenue  
echo "How much have you spent to upgrade your home"

USING Scripts for package management:
====================================
We can install, remove, updates and upgrade packages in our servers.
examples of packages:
   nano, tree, vim, httpd, 
   java, maven, tomcat, jenkins, kubernetes, kubelet, docker

We can download and install packages using package managers like:
   yum/dnf          -- centos, redhat
   apt/apt-get      -- ubuntu, debain
   chocolatey/choco -- windows OS  
   brew             --  mac  
   helm, pip, 

We can download and install packages using commands like:
   wget and curl    

yum install tree 
yum install tree  -y 

package.sh  
 sudo yum install tree -y 
 sudo yum install python -y 
 sudo yum install vim wget -y 

apache.sh 
#!/bin/sh
 # This script will install and start the apache http webServer
 sudo yum install httpd -y 
 sudo systemctl start httpd
 sudo systemctl enable httpd
 systemctl status httpd
 
 =# This script also does file management
 filemgt.sh  
 sudo mkdir /var/www/html/google
 sudo mkdir /var/www/html/yahoo
 sudo echo "DevOps-google" >> /var/www/html/google/index.html

Loops
Loops : condition with multiple iterations 
Syntax:
for ( condition ) 
do
execute here all command/script until the condition is
not satisfied. (And repeat all statement between do and done)

done  


Load testing:
  Banking application server   

accept requests 
memory = 16000MB
for ( RAM >= 500MB )
do
continue to accept request
done    
  1 
  2 
  3 
  10000000
  20000000
  2000009 

Syntax:
or-loop:
   c/c++/java:
for ( initiallation;conditions;inc/dec )
{
  write statements/commands
}

shell-script:
for loops:
==========
for (( initiation;conditions;inc/dec ))
do 
commands 
commands 
done
4loop.sh   
echo "for loop starts"
for (( a=1;a<6;a++  ))
do  
echo $a
done
echo "for loop ends"
Expected output:
   a = 1  
   a = 1 + 1 = 2 
   a = 2 + 1 = 3
   a = 3 + 1 = 4  
   a = 4 + 1 = 5
   -------------- loop breaks 
   a = 5 + 1 = 6    

Assignment:
  Write a shell script to print numbers from 100-90 
   using for-loop

Examples of autamted tasks:
  Explain your experience in bash shell scripting??
  In Landmark I have written and Maintained/modify
  shell scripts to:
    monitor_servers.sh  
    dataBase_backup.sh 
    deploy_app.sh 
    access_account.sh  
    user_management.sh  
    file_management.sh

            $0       $1    $2      $3
   $# = 3
   $@ = dev simon prod  


Functions:   
 A function is a piece of code that perfoms
 a specific task and avoids repetition/duplication.

1. Define a function
   syntax for Functions in shell scripting???
   
   fn() {
    commands
   }
  fn   
  ----
fn.sh 
usermgt() {
   echo "Please enter the username for your user"
   read username  
   sudo useradd $username     
}

fn.sh 
#!/bin/sh
#Learning function in scripting
usermgt() {
   echo "Please enter the username for your user"
   read username
   sudo useradd $username
   echo $username account created successfully
   id $username
   grep $username /etc/passwd
}
# invoke or call and use the functions as desired
echo creating class29 useraccount

=====================
Scheduling Tasks/Workloads to run automatically.
Assignment/Ticket:
  1. Write a script that monitors servers every minutes 
     This script should alert management of anomalies 
  2. Write a script that backup dbServers every midnight
Execution:
1. We shall use cronJobs and create cron tables to achieve this 
   Automation and Schedule the tasks to run as expected. 

   cron table   = contains scheduled tasks   
   crontab -e   = To edit the cron table 
   crontab -l   = List the cron table


Access to the crontab should be restricted because
 1. processes/Workloads consumes systems resources [cpu, Memory]
 2. some Tasks can affect processes and shutdown the system   
How to restrict crontab access:
   sudo touch /etc/cron.allow [simon]

       or   
   sudo touch /etc/cron.deny [simon]

Explain the d/f b/w redirect (>) and append (>>)
   echo DevOps > rich -- 
      This is redirection which replaces the file content  
   echo DevOps >> rich  
      This is appending which add to the file content
